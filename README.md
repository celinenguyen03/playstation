# PlayStation Marketing Insights - Project Overview

## The goal of this project is to investigate the PlayStation ecosystem at PlayStation in order to surface recommendations on marketing allocation for 2025 campaigns aimed at enhancing player engagement and retention.

PlayStation, a leading brand in the gaming industry, offers a vast ecosystem of consoles, games, and subscription services, most notably PlayStation Plus. Understanding how players interact with this ecosystem is crucial for driving user satisfaction, long-term engagement, and ultimately, revenue through game sales and PlayStation Plus subscriptions. With a focus on optimizing marketing efforts for the upcoming year, this analysis seeks to provide actionable insights into player behavior and preferences. The budget is allocated to drive two primary objectives: 1) to improve player retention within the PlayStation ecosystem, and 2) to raise engagement with PlayStation services and content across the global player base.

## Dataset Structure

The analysis utilized three key datasets containing information about PlayStation users and their interactions, and subscription records for PlayStation Plus members.

## Insights Summary

In order to evaluate player engagement, we focused on the following key metrics:

* **Churn Rate**: The percentage of PlayStation Plus subscribers who did not renew their membership.
* **Subscription Rate**: The percentage of PlayStation users who have purchased a PlayStation Plus plan compared to free members.
* **Game Played Count**: The total number of times individual players launched and played games.
* **Average Playtime**: The average duration of a single game play session per player.

**Churn Rate**
* Across user tenure groups, 31-90 days (recent members) had the highest churn rate (12.1%).
* These could be due to many PlayStation Plus subscribers making use of the first month free who subsequently cancel to avoid paying for additional months.
* Surprisingly, fresh members (0-30 days) and more tenured members (91-365 days) share a very similar churn rate of 11.43% and 11.30% respectively.

**Subscription Rate**
* Across all regions, Europe and Northa America experienced the lowest subscription rate at a rate of 68.45% and 68.90% respectively.
* The Plus Tiers all experienced a very similar amount of subscriptions, averaging to around 23% per Plus tiers (Essential, Extra, and Premium), with roughly 30% of all PlayStation users having no subscription plan at all.
* Overall, the total subscription rate of users is the highest among fresh members, and it consistently gets lower the older an active PlayStation user is, starting at 74.4% for fresh members, waning off to 69.3% for legacy members (older than a year).

**Game Played Count**
* The most played titles available in the PlayStation were Fortnite, GTA V, and Marvel's Spider Man, ranging from 105k, 100k, 96k gaming sessions respectively.
* Fortnite had the highest amount of gaming sessions, which could be due to quick match times causing frequent closing and opening of this game.
* Adventure genre games tend to have less gaming sessions per user, but experience longer playtimes per session.

**Average Playtime**
* On average, each PlayStation user spent around 60 minutes per gaming session across all subscription types and games.
* Action genres and subgenres had the longest playtime sessions, averaging to well over 2 hours per session, which is 2x the amount of average playtime sessions.
* Certain games like Final Fantasy, Elden Ring, NieR Automata, and Minecraft had the highest average playtime compare to other popular titles with more frequent shorter sessions.

## Recommendations

* Introductory Offers: Explore limited-time offers or exclusive content for new subscribers, who has the highest subscription rate among users. Subsequently, analyze user activity patterns and survey churned users to understand why users churn around the 1-3 month mark.
* Loyalty Rewards Program: Introduce new benefits like loyalty rewards for long-term subscribers to incentivize Plus members to stay for longer periods and reward our tenured members.
* Regional Marketing Strategies: Investigate Europe and North America regions to understand their low subscription rates. Collect user data on regional pricing and attitudinal data on communication quality in these regions.
* Game-Specific Opportunities: Offer exclusive in-game content, discounts, or early access to expansions for the popular titles for PlayStation Plus subscribers to incentivize joining the PlayStation ecosystem.
